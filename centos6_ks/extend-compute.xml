<description>

	A skeleton XML node file. This file is a template and is intended
	as an example of how to customize your Rocks cluster. Kickstart XML
	nodes such as this describe packages and "post installation" shell
	scripts for your cluster.

	XML files in the site-nodes/ directory should be named either
	"extend-[name].xml" or "replace-[name].xml", where [name] is
	the name of an existing xml node. 

	If your node is prefixed with replace, its instructions will be used
	instead of the official node's. If it is named extend, its directives
	will be concatenated to the end of the official node.
