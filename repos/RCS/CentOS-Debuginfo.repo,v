# The mirror system uses the connecting IP address of the client and the
# update status of each mirror to pick mirrors that are updated to and
# geographically close to the client.  You should use this for CentOS updates
# unless you are manually picking other mirrors.
#

# All debug packages from all the various CentOS-5 releases
# are merged into a single repo, split by BaseArch
#
# Note: packages in the debuginfo repo are currently not signed
